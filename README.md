# Blue-Tarps
DS 6030 final project - UVA

This is my final project for DS 6030 Statistical Learning. I used R markdown.

Refugees were using blue tarps as temporary shelter. Aircraft images were taken to locate blue tarps. 

Created 7 models to locate blue tarps. Chose 1 model which found 96% of all blue tarps with an 89% accuracy of locations identified to hold a blue tarp, holding a blue tarp (96% TPR, 89% Precision)


The hold out data is zipped and the final results are shown in my pdf/html report. 

I saved models that take a long time to train to speed up code runtime and so that model only needs to be trained once. Unfortunately these files are too big to upload to git hub. The code will still work without them. It will just take a longer time to run.
