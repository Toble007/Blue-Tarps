DS 6030 final project - UVA


This is my final project for DS 6030 Statistical Learning.

The hold out data is zipped and the final results are shown in my pdf/html report. 

I saved models to speed up code runtime and so a model only needs to be trained once. Unfortunately these files are too big to upload to git hub. The code will still work without them. It will just take a longer time to run.
